# WebRTC Demos

Listed below are some demos that are written by the rtc.io team to help demonstrate how the rtc.io modules work.  In most cases the demos are visually very simple, but hopefully give you an idea of what you can do from
a functionality point of view.

### rtc-quickconnect demo

A simple demo making use of the `rtc-quickconnect` module to demonstrate how you could create a simple video conferencing application with text chat via data channels.

__NOTE:__ Experimental, Chrome 32+ required.

### rtc-signaller demo

A simple chat room demo that makes use of `rtc-signaller` to communicate with peers via websockets.  The `rtc-signaller` module is used by many of the rtc.io modules for the handshaking process required to set up a new WebRTC peer connection.

## rtc.io Module Sightings

In addition to the above demos, listed below are projects that we have come across from around the web that use rtc.io modules.
