# What is WebRTC?

WebRTC is enabling a revolution of web communications, but it can be tricky
to get started.

The rtc.io suite is a collection of open source node.js modules that can be installed with npm to:

- access local camera and microphone
- create audio and video calls between browsers
- set up data channels between browsers
- provide communication management
- set up a signalling server

You get to pick and choose as needed.

## Testing and WebRTC

All of the stable modules in the rtc.io suite (and some of the unstable ones too) are being tested using continuous integration (a big thanks to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for their excellent service).  We have further information on [our testing process](testing-process.html) if you are interested, and the current build status is displayed with each of our [modules](modules.html).
