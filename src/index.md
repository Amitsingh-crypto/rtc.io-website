# What is WebRTC?

WebRTC is enabling a revolution of web communications, but it can be tricky
to get started.

The rtc.io suite is a collection of open source node.js modules that can be installed with npm to:

- access local camera and microphone
- create audio and video calls between browsers
- set up data channels between browsers
- provide communication management
- set up a signalling server

You get to pick and choose as needed.
