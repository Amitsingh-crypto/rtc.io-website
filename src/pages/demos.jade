    # rtc.io demos
    
    The following is a list of demos that have been created to help you both try
    out and get to know rtc.io:
    
    ## Hello World
    
    This is a literal "Hello World" demo that uses the [`rtc`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc)
    package to implement simple video conferencing.

    ## rtc-quickconnect demo
    
    This is a demo that shows how `rtc-quickconnect` can be used in conjunction
    with media capture packages to implement video conferencing.  It's a little
    bit more work than "Hello World", but also more flexible.
